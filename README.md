# session-organizer

Made for my engineering thesis.

*session-organizer* is an app to make your exam session easier.
It provides tools to organize exams and display them for the students.
The work presents the development and implementation of the web application that supports the management of an exam session. 
The website allows users to create individual and group events, and filter them by date using calendar. 
In addition, the group system was implemented, which allows users, depending on their role, to create, modify and manage them.
